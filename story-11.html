<p>The voice says,"I see you're ready to move on."</p>
<p>"Remember patience is the key..."</p>
<p>The ground below you starts to shake and you feels like it starts to rise!</p>
<p>After a while, the shaking stops and there are four doors.</p>
<p>Which one do you take?</p>
        <a href="story-2.html">Door on the left</a>
        <a href="story-5.html">Door in front of you</a>
        <a href="story-13.html">Door on the right</a>
        <a href="story-3.html">Door behind you</a>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
