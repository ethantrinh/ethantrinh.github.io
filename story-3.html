<p>As you close the door behind you, you hear a "click".</p>
<p>You turn around and try to open the door and find out that it has been locked</p>
<p>The path ahead is very long so you decide to start walking</p>
<p>Suddenly you take a step and feel yourself falling.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you are falling through the air and eventually land on the ground very hard.</p>
<p>You look up and see a sign on a door in front of you that says, "Try again"</p>
<p>You try to get up but feel like you pulled a muscle, so you decide to take a rest before you go through the door.</p>
